-- Step 1: Connecting to the Database
-- This step may vary depending on the database system you're using and the specific configuration.

-- Step 2: Understanding the Data Schema
-- Explore the database schema to understand the structure of the tables and relationships.
DESCRIBE table_name;

-- Step 3: Sampling Data
-- Sample a portion of the data for initial exploration.
SELECT *
FROM table_name
LIMIT 100; -- Sample 100 rows

-- Step 4: Descriptive Statistics
-- Calculate descriptive statistics for numeric columns.
SELECT 
    COUNT(column_name) AS count,
    AVG(column_name) AS average,
    MIN(column_name) AS min,
    MAX(column_name) AS max,
    STDDEV(column_name) AS stddev
FROM table_name;

-- Step 5: Data Cleansing
-- Handle missing or invalid values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
-- Example: Remove rows with missing values
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE column_name IS NULL;

-- Step 6: Exploring Relationships
-- Write queries to explore relationships between different variables.
SELECT 
    category_column,
    AVG(numeric_column) AS avg_numeric
FROM table_name
GROUP BY category_column;

-- Step 7: Visualizations
-- Extract data for visualization using SQL, then use other tools for visualization.
-- Example: Extract data for plotting histogram
SELECT 
    column_name,
    COUNT(*) AS count
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name;

-- Step 8: Iterative Analysis
-- Repeat the above steps as needed, adjusting queries and exploring different aspects of the dataset.
